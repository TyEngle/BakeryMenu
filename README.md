Created For: Bakery Bakery to better display to their customers what items they currently have as well as that which is no longer available--QAP3 for Front End Development, Semester 2 of Software Development, hosted by Keyin College.

Created On: April 6, 2022.

Created in VSCode.

Contents are a CSS folder, JS folder, and the main Index page.

CSS is mostly a boilerplate taken from the internet--given by instructor.

JS contains all the events that happen on the webpage.

Index page is where our contents are displayed.
